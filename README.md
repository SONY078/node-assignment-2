Installing
Assuming youâ€™ve already installed Node.js, create a directory to hold your application, and make that your working directory.

$ mkdir myapp
$ cd myapp

Use the npm init command to create a package.json file for your application. 

$ npm init

Enter app.js, or whatever you want the name of the main file to be. If you want it to be index.js, hit RETURN to accept the suggested default file name.

Now install Express in the myapp directory and save it in the dependencies list. For example:

$ npm install express

To install Express temporarily and not add it to the dependencies list:

$ npm install express --no-save
